Hi, I'm Darien!

I am insatiably curious, quick-witted, and caring.

Currently, my favorite hobby includes reading and thinking about business and startups.
Before joining Lambda School, I was the founder of both a marketing and consulting firm.
My passion for business was born out of a deep desire to solve everyday problems I saw around me.
Once I finish Lambda School, I plan to use my programming skills to build new companies.
